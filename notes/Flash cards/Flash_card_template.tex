%Database terminology
\qa{Define a Primary Key}{An attribute that \emph{uniquely} defines each row}
\qa{Define a foreign Key}{An attribute whose value matches the primary key of a related table}
\qa{Define entity integrity}{The property of a relational table that
guarantees that each entity has a unique value in a primary
key and that there are no null values in the primary key.}
\qa{Define referential integirty}{A condition by which a dependent
table’s foreign key must have either a null entry or a
matching entry in the related table. Even though an attribute
may not have a corresponding attribute, it is impossible to
have an invalid entry.}

diagram resulting from the application of extended entity
relationship concepts that provide additional semantic
content zrein the ER model.}

\qa{Define a feature}{An attribute of an entity} 
%features of a relational table
\qa{list 8 Characteristics of a relational table}{
\begin{itemize}
	\item A table is perceived as a two-dimensional structure composed of rows and columns.
	\item Each table row (tuple) represents a single entity occurrence within the entity set.
	\item Each table column represents an attribute, and each column has a distinct name.
	\item  Each row/column intersection represents a single data value.
	\item All values in a column must conform to the same data format
	\item Each column has a specific range of values known as the attribute domain.
	\item The order of the rows and columns is immaterial to the DBMS. 
	\item Each table must have an attribute or a combination of attributes that uniquely identifies each row. 
\end{itemize}

%define the concept of keys
\qa{define the concept of a key}{An entity identifier based on the concept of functional
dependence} 
%identify and use different types of keys
\qa{define a  Superkey}{an
attribute (or combination of attributes) that uniquely
identifies each entity in a table}
\qa{define a Primary key}{a
candidate key selected as a unique entity identifier}
\qa{define a Secondary key}{a key that is used strictly for data retrieval
purposes. For example, a customer is not likely to know his
or her customer number (primary key), but the combination
of last name, first name, middle initial, and telephone
number is likely to make a match to the appropriate table
row}
\qa{define a Foreign key}{an attribute (or combination of attributes)
in one table whose values must match the primary key in
another table or whose values must be null.}
\qa{define a Candidate key}{a minimal
superkey, that is, one that does not contain a subset of
attributes that is itself a superkey}
\qa{list 6 desirable attributes of a primary key}{
\begin{itemize}
	\item Stable : does not change over time
	\item Minimal: Fewest attributes necessary

guarantees that each entity has a unique value in a primary
key and that there are no null values in the primary key.}
