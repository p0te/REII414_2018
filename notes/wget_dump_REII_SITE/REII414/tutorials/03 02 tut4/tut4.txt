1. Show the description of the most expensive product that is in stock.
select P_DESCRIPT from PRODUCT order by P_PRICE desc limit 1

2. A customer buys everything in stock of the most expensive product. Write a query that will reduce the quantity on hand of that specific product code (determined in 1) by the same amount, so that it ends up being zero.
select P_CODE from PRODUCT order by P_PRICE desc limit 1;
update PRODUCT set P_QOH = 0 where P_CODE = '89-WRE-Q';
-- Single query "not yet" supported by MariaDB:
update PRODUCT set P_QOH = 0 where P_CODE in (select P_CODE from PRODUCT order by P_PRICE desc limit 1);

3. List all the products containing the text "jigsaw" in their description.
select * from PRODUCT where P_DESCRIPT like '%jigsaw%'

4. List all the products that are below their ordering threshold in terms of quantity on hand.
select P_CODE, P_DESCRIPT from PRODUCT where P_QOH < P_MIN

5. List all the customers who have completely settled their accounts.
select CUS_CODE, CUS_LNAME, CUS_FNAME from CUSTOMER where CUS_BALANCE = 0
