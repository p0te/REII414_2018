<blockquote>
<p>The connection between the language in which we think/program and the
problems and solutions we can imagine is very close.  For this reason
restricting language features with the intent of eliminating programmer
errors is at best dangerous.</p>

<p>-- Bjarne Stroustrup</p>

<p>Mr. Stroustrup is the inventor of the C++ programming language, but
quite an insightful person nevertheless.</p>
