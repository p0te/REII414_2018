<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>When personal computers were first introduced, most of them came equipped with
a simple programming language, usually a variant of
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BASIC">BASIC</a>. Interacting with the computer
was closely integrated with this language, and thus every computer-user,
whether he wanted to or not, would get a taste of it. Now that computers have
become plentiful and cheap, typical users don&#8217;t get much further than clicking
things with a mouse. For most people, this works very well. But for those of us
with a natural inclination towards technological tinkering, the removal of
programming from every-day computer use presents something of a barrier.</p>
<p>Fortunately, as an effect of developments in the World Wide Web, it so happens
that every computer equipped with a modern web-browser also has an environment
for programming JavaScript. In today&#8217;s spirit of not bothering the user with
technical details, it is kept well hidden, but a web-page can make it
accessible, and use it as a platform for learning to program.</p>
<p>That is what this (hyper-)book tries to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>I do not enlighten those who are not eager to learn, nor arouse
those who are not anxious to give an explanation themselves. If I
have presented one corner of the square and they cannot come back
to me with the other three, I should not go over the points again.</em>
― Confucius</div></blockquote>
<p>Besides explaining JavaScript, this book tries to be an introduction to the
basic principles of programming. Programming, it turns out, is hard. The
fundamental rules are, most of the time, simple and clear. But programs, while
built on top of these basic rules, tend to become complex enough to introduce
their own rules, their own complexity. Because of this, programming is rarely
simple or predictable. As
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Donald_Knuth">Donald Knuth</a>, who is something
of a founding father of the field, says, it is an <em>art</em>.</p>
<p>To get something out of this book, more than just passive reading is required.
Try to stay sharp, make an effort to solve the exercises, and only continue on
when you are reasonably sure you understand the material that came before.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><em>The computer programmer is a creator of universes for which he alone is
responsible. Universes of virtually unlimited complexity can be created in
the form of computer programs.</em>
― Joseph Weizenbaum, Computer Power and Human Reason</div></blockquote>
<p>A program is many things. It is a piece of text typed by a programmer, it is
the directing force that makes the computer do what it does, it is data in the
computer&#8217;s memory, yet it controls the actions performed on this same memory.
Analogies that try to compare programs to objects we are familiar with tend to
fall short, but a superficially fitting one is that of a machine. The gears of
a mechanical watch fit together ingeniously, and if the watchmaker was any
good, it will accurately show the time for many years. The elements of a
program fit together in a similar way, and if the programmer knows what he is
doing, the program will run without crashing.</p>
<p>A computer is a machine built to act as a host for these immaterial machines.
Computers themselves can only do stupidly straightforward things. The reason
they are so useful is that they do these things at an incredibly high speed. A
program can, by ingeniously combining many of these simple actions, do very
complicated things.</p>
<p>To some of us, writing computer programs is a fascinating game. A program is a
building of thought. It is costless to build, weightless, growing easily under
our typing hands. If we get carried away, its size and complexity will grow out
of control, confusing even the one who created it. This is the main problem of
programming. It is why so much of today&#8217;s software tends to crash, fail, screw
up.</p>
<p>When a program works, it is beautiful. The art of programming is the skill of
controlling complexity. The great program is subdued, made simple in its
complexity.</p>
<p>The landscape of programming techniques is enormous, fascinating in its
diversity, still largely unexplored. It is certainly littered with traps and
snares, luring the inexperienced programmer into all kinds of horrible
mistakes, but that only means you should proceed with caution, keep your wits
about you. As you learn, there will always be new challenges, new territory to
explore. The programmer who refuses to keep exploring will surely stagnate,
forget his joy, lose the will to program (and become a manager).</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In the beginning, at the birth of computing, there were no programming
languages. Programs looked something like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre>00110001 00000000 00000000
00110001 00000001 00000001
00110011 00000001 00000010
01010001 00001011 00000010
00100010 00000010 00001000
01000011 00000001 00000000
01000001 00000001 00000001
00010000 00000010 00000000
01100010 00000000 00000000
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That is a program to add the numbers from one to ten together, and print out
the result (1 + 2 + ... + 10 = 55). It could run on a very simple kind of
computer. To program early computers, it was necessary to set large arrays of
switches in the right position, or punch holes in strips of cardboard and feed
them to the computer.  You can imagine how this was a tedious, error-prone
procedure. Even the writing of simple programs required much cleverness and
discipline, complex ones were nearly inconceivable.</p>
<p>Of course, manually entering these arcane patterns of bits (which is what the
1s and 0s above are generally called) did give the programmer a profound sense
of being a mighty wizard. And that has to be worth something, in terms of job
satisfaction.</p>
<p>Each line of the program contains a single instruction. It could be written in
English like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Store the number 0 in memory location 0</li>
<li>Store the number 1 in memory location 1</li>
<li>Store the value of memory location 1 in memory location 2</li>
<li>Subtract the number 11 from the value in memory location 2</li>
<li>If the value in memory location 2 is the number 0, continue with instruction
9</li>
<li>Add the value of memory location 1 to memory location 0</li>
<li>Add the number 1 to the value of memory location 1</li>
<li>Continue with instruction 3</li>
<li>Output the value of memory location 0</li>
</ol>
<p>While that is more readable than the binary soup, it is still rather
unpleasant. It might help to use names instead of numbers for the instructions
and memory locations:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre> Set &#39;total&#39; to 0
 Set &#39;count&#39; to 1
[loop]
 Set &#39;compare&#39; to &#39;count&#39;
 Subtract 11 from &#39;compare&#39;
 If &#39;compare&#39; is zero, continue at [end]
 Add &#39;count&#39; to &#39;total&#39;
 Add 1 to &#39;count&#39;
 Continue at [loop]
[end]
 Output &#39;total&#39;
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At this point it is not too hard to see how the program works. Can you? The
first two lines give two memory locations their starting values: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">total</span></tt> will
be used to build up the result of the program, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">count</span></tt> keeps track of the
number that we are currently looking at. The lines using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">compare</span></tt> are
probably the weirdest ones. What the program wants to do is see if <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">count</span></tt> is
equal to 11, in order to decide whether it can stop yet. Because the machine is
so primitive, it can only test whether a number is zero, and make a decision
(jump) based on that. So it uses the memory location labelled <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">compare</span></tt> to
compute the value of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">count</span> <span class="pre">-</span> <span class="pre">11</span></tt>, and makes a decision based on that value.
The next two lines add the value of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">count</span></tt> to the result, and increment
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">count</span></tt> by one every time the program has decided that it is not 11 yet.</p>
<p>Here is the same program in JavaScript:</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">total</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">count</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">count</span> <span class="o">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">total</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="nx">count</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nx">count</span> <span class="o">+=</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">total</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This gives us a few more improvements. Most importantly, there is no need to
specify the way we want the program to jump back and forth anymore. The magic
word <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">while</span></tt> takes care of that. It continues executing the lines below it as
long as the condition it was given holds: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">count</span> <span class="pre">&lt;=</span> <span class="pre">10</span></tt>, which means
&#8216;<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">count</span></tt> is less than or equal to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">10</span></tt>&#8216;. Apparently, there is no need
anymore to create a temporary value and compare that to zero. This was a stupid
little detail, and the power of programming languages is that they take care of
stupid little details for us.</p>
<p>Finally, here is what the program could look like if we happened to have the
convenient operations <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">print</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">range</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sum</span></tt> available, which
respectively print out the results of a computation to some convenient output
location, create a collection of numbers within a range and compute the sum of
a collection of numbers:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">10</span><span class="p">)));</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>In another programming language called <a class="reference external" href="http://python.org">Python</a>, the
following program much like the hypothetical one above will run and produce
the result we seek:</p>
<div class="last highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">print</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">sum</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">))</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
</div>
<p>The moral of this story, then, is that the same program can be expressed in
long and short, unreadable and readable ways. The first version of the program
was extremely obscure, while this last one is almost English: <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">print</span></tt> the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sum</span></tt> of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">range</span></tt> of numbers from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span></tt> to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">10</span></tt>. (We will see in later
chapters how to build things like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sum</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">range</span></tt>.)</p>
<p>A good programming language helps the programmer by providing a more abstract
way to express himself. It hides uninteresting details, provides convenient
building blocks (such as the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">while</span></tt> construct), and, most of the time,
allows the programmer to add building blocks himself (such as the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">sum</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">range</span></tt> operations).</p>
<p id="index-0"><a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript">JavaScript</a> is the language that
is, at the moment, mostly being used to do all kinds of clever and horrible
things with pages on the World Wide Web. Some people claim that the next
version of JavaScript will become an important language for other tasks too. I
am unsure whether that will happen, but if you are interested in programming,
JavaScript is definitely a useful language to learn.  Even if you do not end up
doing much web programming, the mind-bending programs I will show you in this
book will always stay with you, haunt you, and influence the programs you write
in other languages.</p>
<p>There are those who will say <em>terrible</em> things about JavaScript.  Many of these
things are true. When I was for the first time required to write something in
JavaScript, I quickly came to despise the language. It would accept almost
anything I typed, but interpret it in a way that was completely different from
what I meant. This had a lot to do with the fact that I did not have a clue
what I was doing, but there is also a real issue here: JavaScript is
ridiculously liberal in what it allows. The idea behind this design was that it
would make programming in JavaScript easier for beginners. In actuality, it
mostly makes finding problems in your programs harder, because the system will
not point them out to you.</p>
<p>However, the flexibility of the language is also an advantage. It leaves space
for a lot of techniques that are impossible in more rigid languages, and it can
be used to overcome some of JavaScript&#8217;s shortcomings. After learning it
properly, and working with it for a while, I have really learned to <em>like</em> this
language.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Contrary to what the name suggests, JavaScript has very little to do with the
programming language named Java. The similar name was inspired by marketing
considerations, rather than good judgement.  In 1995, when JavaScript was
introduced by Netscape, the Java language was being heavily marketed and
gaining in popularity.  Apparently, someone thought it a good idea to try and
ride along on this marketing. Now we are stuck with the name.</p>
<p>Related to JavaScript is a thing called ECMAScript. When browsers other than
Netscape started to support JavaScript, or something that looked like it, a
document was written to describe precisely how the language should work. The
language described in this document is called
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript">ECMAScript</a>, after the
organisation that standardised it.</p>
<p>ECMAScript describes a general-purpose programming language, and does not say
anything about the integration of this language in an Internet browser.
JavaScript is ECMAScript plus extra tools for dealing with Internet pages and
browser windows.</p>
<p>A few other pieces of software use the language described in the ECMAScript
document. Most importantly, the
<a class="reference external" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript">ActionScript</a> language used by
Flash is based on ECMAScript (though it does not precisely follow the
standard). Flash is a system for adding things that move and make lots of noise
to web-pages. Knowing JavaScript won&#8217;t hurt if you ever find yourself learning
to build Flash movies.</p>
<p>JavaScript is still evolving. Since this book came out, ECMAScript 5 has been
released, which is compatible with the version described here, but adds some of
the functionality we will be writing ourselves as built-in methods. The newest
generation of browsers provides this expanded version of JavaScript. As of
2011, &#8216;ECMAScript harmony&#8217;, a more radical extension of the language, is in the
process of being standardised. You should not worry too much about these new
versions making the things you learn from this book obsolete. For one thing,
they will be an extension of the language we have now, so almost everything
written in this book will still hold.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p id="index-1">Most chapters in this book contain quite a lot of <strong>code</strong>. In my experience,
reading and writing code is an important part of learning to program. Try to
not just glance over these examples, but read them attentively and understand
them.  This can be slow and confusing at first, but you will quickly get the
hang of it. The same goes for the exercises. Don&#8217;t assume you understand them
until you&#8217;ve actually written a working solution.</p>
<p>Because of the way the web works, it is always possible to look at the
JavaScript programs that people put in their web-pages. This can be a good way
to learn how some things are done. Because most web programmers are not
&#8220;professional&#8221; programmers, or consider JavaScript programming so uninteresting
that they never properly learned it, a lot of the code you can find like this
is of a <em>very</em> bad quality. When learning from ugly or incorrect code, the
ugliness and confusion will propagate into your own code, so be careful who you
learn from.</p>
<div class="section" id="how-to-run-javascript-programs">
<h2>How to Run JavaScript Programs<a class="headerlink" href="#how-to-run-javascript-programs" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since the only way to learn the art of programming in JavaScript is to write
lots and lots of your own programs, you should start in right at the beginning
by using the example programs you see in this book.</p>
<p>Do not hesitate to modify and try out the example programs. Proceed without
fear as you try changes that occur to you to see what they do.  The worst that
could happen is that you create an endless loop. Fortunately, browsers keep an
eye on the programs running inside them. Whenever one of them is taking
suspiciously long to finish, they will ask you if you want to cut it off.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">An endless loop is what you get when the condition of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">while</span></tt> never
becomes false, for example if you choose to add <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0</span></tt> instead of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span></tt> to
the count variable in the previous example. Now the program will run
forever.</p>
