<span id="modularity-chapter"></span><h1>12. Modularity<a class="headerlink" href="#modularity" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This chapter deals with the process of organising programs. In small programs,
organisation rarely becomes a problem. As a program grows, however, it can
reach a size where its structure and interpretation become hard to keep track
of. Easily enough, such a program starts to look like a bowl of spaghetti, an
amorphous mass in which everything seems to be connected to everything else.</p>
<p>When structuring a program, we do two things. We separate it into smaller
parts, called modules, each of which has a specific role, and we specify the
relations between these parts.</p>
<p>In <a class="reference internal" href="ch11.html#oop-chapter"><em>Object-oriented Programming</em></a>, while developing a terrarium, we made use of a number of
functions described in <a class="reference internal" href="ch09.html#functional-programming-chapter"><em>Functional Programming</em></a>. The chapter also
defined a few new concepts that had nothing in particular to do with terraria,
such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">clone</span></tt> and the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dictionary</span></tt> type. All these things were
haphazardly added to the environment. One way to split this program into
modules would be:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>A module <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FunctionalTools</span></tt>, which contains the functions from
<a class="reference internal" href="ch09.html#functional-programming-chapter"><em>Functional Programming</em></a>, and depends on nothing.</li>
<li>Then <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ObjectTools</span></tt>, which contains things like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">clone</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">create</span></tt>,
and depends on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FunctionalTools</span></tt>.</li>
<li><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dictionary</span></tt>, containing the dictionary type, and depending on
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FunctionalTools</span></tt>.</li>
<li>And finally the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Terrarium</span></tt> module, which depends on <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">ObjectTools</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dictionary</span></tt>.</li>
</ul>
<p>When a module depends on another module, it uses functions or variables from
that module, and will only work when this module is loaded.</p>
<p>It is a good idea to make sure dependencies never form a circle.  Not only do
circular dependencies create a practical problem (if module <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt>
depend on each other, which one should be loaded first?), it also makes the
relation between the modules less straightforward, and can result in a
modularised version of the spaghetti I mentioned earlier.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Most modern programming languages have some kind of module system built in. Not
JavaScript. Once again, we have to invent something ourselves. The most obvious
way to start is to put every module in a different file. This makes it clear
which code belongs to which module.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In some cases, giving load commands in the wrong order will result in errors.
If a module tries to create a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dictionary</span></tt> object, but the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dictionary</span></tt>
module has not been loaded yet, it will be unable to find the constructor, and
will fail.</p>
<p>One would imagine this to be easy to solve. Just put some calls to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load</span></tt> at
the top of the file for a module, to load all the modules it depends on.
Unfortunately, because of the way browsers work, calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load</span></tt> does not
immediately cause the given file to be loaded. The file will be loaded <em>after</em>
the current file has finished executing. Which is too late, usually.</p>
<p>In most cases, the practical solution is to just manage dependencies by hand:
Put the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">script</span></tt> tags in your HTML documents in the right order.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>There are two ways to (partially) automate dependency management.  The first is
to keep a separate file with information about the dependencies between
modules. This can be loaded first, and used to determine the order in which to
load the files. The second way is to not use a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">script</span></tt> tag (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load</span></tt>
internally creates and adds such a tag), but to fetch the content of the file
directly (see <a class="reference internal" href="ch08.html#http-requests-chapter"><em>HTTP requests</em></a>), and then use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eval</span></tt> function
to execute it. This makes script loading instantaneous, and thus easier to deal
with.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eval</span></tt>, short for &#8216;evaluate&#8217;, is an interesting function. You give it a
string value, and it will execute the content of the string as JavaScript code.</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nb">eval</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;print(\&quot;I am a string inside a string!\&quot;);&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can imagine that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eval</span></tt> can be used to do some interesting things. Code
can build new code, and run it. In most cases, however, problems that can be
solved with creative uses of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eval</span></tt> can also be solved with creative uses of
anonymous functions, and the latter is less likely to cause strange problems.</p>
<p>When <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eval</span></tt> is called inside a function, all new variables will become local
to that function. Thus, when a variation of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load</span></tt> would use <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">eval</span></tt>
internally, loading the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dictionary</span></tt> module would create a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dictionary</span></tt>
constructor inside of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">load</span></tt> function, which would be lost as soon as the
function returned. There are ways to work around this, but they are rather
clumsy.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Let us quickly go over the first variant of dependency management.  It requires
a special file for dependency information, which could look something like
this:</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">dependencies</span> <span class="o">=</span>
    <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;ObjectTools.js&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;FunctionalTools.js&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
     <span class="s2">&quot;Dictionary.js&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span>  <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;ObjectTools.js&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span>
     <span class="s2">&quot;TestModule.js&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span>  <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;FunctionalTools.js&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Dictionary.js&quot;</span><span class="p">]};</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dependencies</span></tt> object contains a property for each file that depends on
other files. The values of the properties are arrays of file names. Note that
we could not use a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dictionary</span></tt> object here, because we can not be sure that
the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dictionary</span></tt> module has been loaded yet. Because all the properties in
this object will end in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;.js&quot;</span></tt>, they are unlikely to interfere with hidden
properties like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">__proto__</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">hasOwnProperty</span></tt>, and a regular object will
work fine.</p>
<p>The dependency manager must do two things. Firstly it must make sure that files
are loaded in the correct order, by loading a file&#8217;s dependencies before the
file itself. And secondly, it must make sure that no file is loaded twice.
Loading the same file twice might cause problems, and is definitely a waste of
time.</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">loadedFiles</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{};</span>

<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">file</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">dependencies</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">file</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">files</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">dependencies</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">file</span><span class="p">];</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nx">files</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">i</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">files</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">i</span><span class="p">]);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="nx">loadedFiles</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">file</span><span class="p">])</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">loadedFiles</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">file</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="nx">load</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">file</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">require</span></tt> function can now be used to load a file and all its
dependencies. Note how it recursively calls itself to take care of dependencies
(and possible dependencies of that dependency).</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;TestModule.js&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">test</span><span class="p">();</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Building a program as a set of nice, small modules often means the program will
use a lot of different files. When programming for the web, having lots of
small JavaScript files on a page tends to make the page slower to load. This
does not have to be a problem though.  You can write and test your program as a
number of small files, and put them all into a single big file when
&#8220;publishing&#8221; the program to the web.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Just like an object type, a module has an interface. In simple
collection-of-functions modules such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">FunctionalTools</span></tt>, the interface
usually consists of all the functions that are defined in the module. In other
cases, the interface of the module is only a small part of the functions
defined inside it. For example, our manuscript-to-HTML system from
<a class="reference internal" href="ch09.html#functional-programming-chapter"><em>Functional Programming</em></a> only needs an interface of a single
function, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">renderFile</span></tt>. (The sub-system for building HTML would be a separate
module.)</p>
<p>For modules which only define a single type of object, such as <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Dictionary</span></tt>,
the object&#8217;s interface is the same as the module&#8217;s interface.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>In JavaScript, &#8220;top-level&#8221; variables all live together in a single place. In
browsers, this place is an object that can be found under the name <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">window</span></tt>.
The name is somewhat odd, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">environment</span></tt> or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">top</span></tt> would have made more
sense, but since browsers associate a JavaScript environment with a window (or
&#8216;frame&#8217;), someone decided that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">window</span></tt> was a logical name.</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">print</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nx">print</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>As the third line shows, the name <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">window</span></tt> is merely a property of this
environment object, pointing at itself.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>When much code is loaded into an environment, it will use many top-level
variable names. Once there is more code than you can really keep track of, it
becomes very easy to accidentally use a name that was already used for
something else. This will break the code that used the original value. The
proliferation of top-level variables is called name-space pollution, and it can
be a rather severe problem in JavaScript ― the language will not warn you when
you redefine an existing variable.</p>
<p>There is no way to get rid of this problem entirely, but it can be greatly
reduced by taking care to cause as little pollution as possible. For one thing,
modules should not use top-level variables for values that are not part of
their external interface.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Not being able to define any internal functions and variables at all in your
modules is, of course, not very practical. Fortunately, there is a trick to get
around this. We write all the code for the module inside a function, and then
finally add the variables that are part of the module&#8217;s interface to the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">window</span></tt> object.  Because they were created in the same parent function, all
the functions of the module can see each other, but code outside of the module
can not.</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">buildMonthNameModule</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">names</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;January&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;February&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;March&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;April&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>

    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getMonthName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">names</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">];</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">getMonthNumber</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">for</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">number</span> <span class="o">&lt;</span> <span class="nx">names</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">;</span> <span class="nx">number</span><span class="o">++</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
            <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">names</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
                <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">number</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getMonthName</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">getMonthName</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">getMonthNumber</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">getMonthNumber</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
<span class="nx">buildMonthNameModule</span><span class="p">();</span>

<span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">getMonthName</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>This builds a very simple module for translating between month names and their
number (as used by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Date</span></tt>, where January is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0</span></tt>). But note that
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">buildMonthNameModule</span></tt> is still a top-level variable that is not part of the
module&#8217;s interface. Also, we have to repeat the names of the interface
functions three times. Ugh.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The first problem can be solved by making the module function anonymous, and
calling it directly. To do this, we have to add a pair of parentheses around
the function value, or JavaScript will think it is a normal function
definition, which can not be called directly.</p>
<p>The second problem can be solved with a helper function, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">provide</span></tt>, which can
be given an object containing the values that must be exported into the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">window</span></tt> object.</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">provide</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">values</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">forEachIn</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">values</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nb">window</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Using this, we can write a module like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">names</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="s2">&quot;Sunday&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Monday&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Tuesday&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Wednesday&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
                 <span class="s2">&quot;Thursday&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Friday&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Saturday&quot;</span><span class="p">];</span>
    <span class="nx">provide</span><span class="p">({</span>

<p>I do not recommend writing modules like this right from the start.  While you
are still working on a piece of code, it is easier to just use the simple
approach we have used so far, and put everything at top level. That way, you
can inspect the module&#8217;s internal values in your browser, and test them out.
Once a module is more or less finished, it is not difficult to wrap it in a
function.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>There are cases where a module will export so many variables that it is a bad
idea to put them all into the top-level environment. In cases like this, you
can do what the standard <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Math</span></tt> object does, and represent the module as a
single object whose properties are the functions and values it exports. For
example...</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">HTML</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="nx">tag</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">content</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">properties</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">name</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">name</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">properties</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">properties</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">content</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">content</span><span class="p">};</span>
    <span class="p">},</span>
    <span class="nx">link</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">target</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">HTML</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">tag</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;a&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">text</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">href</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">target</span><span class="p">});</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="cm">/* ... many more HTML-producing functions ... */</span>
<span class="p">};</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When you need the content of such a module so often that it becomes cumbersome
to constantly type <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">HTML</span></tt>, you can always move it into the top-level
environment using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">provide</span></tt>.</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">provide</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">HTML</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">link</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;http://docs.sun.com/source/816-6408-10/object.htm&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span>
           <span class="s2">&quot;This is how objects work.&quot;</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can even combine the function and object approaches, by putting the
internal variables of the module inside a function, and having this function
return an object containing its external interface.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>When adding methods to standard prototypes, such as those of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Array</span></tt> and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Object</span></tt> a similar problem to name-space pollution occurs. If two modules
decide to add a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">map</span></tt> method to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Array.prototype</span></tt>, you might have a
problem. If these two versions of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">map</span></tt> have the precise same effect, things
will continue to work, but only by sheer luck.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Designing an interface for a module or an object type is one of the subtler
aspects of programming. On the one hand, you do not want to expose too many
details. They will only get in the way when using the module. On the other
hand, you do not want to be <em>too</em> simple and general, because that might make
it impossible to use the module in complex or specialised situations.</p>
<p>Sometimes the solution is to provide two interfaces, a detailed &#8220;low-level&#8221; one
for complicated things, and a simple &#8220;high-level&#8221; one for straightforward
situations. The second one can usually be built very easily using the tools
provided by the first one.</p>
<p>In other cases, you just have to find the right idea around which to base your
interface. Compare this to the various approaches to inheritance we saw in
<a class="reference internal" href="ch11.html#oop-chapter"><em>Object-oriented Programming</em></a>. By making prototypes the central concept, rather than
constructors, we managed to make some things considerably more straightforward.</p>
<p>The best way to learn to the value of good interface design is, unfortunately,
to use bad interfaces. Once you get fed up with them, you&#8217;ll figure out a way
to improve them, and learn a lot in the process. Try not to assume that a lousy
interface is &#8220;just the way it is&#8221;. Fix it, or wrap it in a new interface that
is better (we will see an example of this in <a class="reference internal" href="ch06.html#dom-chapter"><em>The Document-Object Model</em></a>).</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>There are functions which require a lot of arguments. Sometimes this means they
are just badly designed, and can easily be remedied by splitting them into a
few more modest functions. But in other cases, there is no way around it.
Typically, some of these arguments have a sensible &#8220;default&#8221; value. We could,
for example, write yet another extended version of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">range</span></tt>.</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">start</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">end</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">stepSize</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">stepSize</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">undefined</span><span class="p">)</span>

    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">result</span><span class="p">;</span>

<span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">range</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kc">undefined</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">4</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">));</span>

</div>
<p>It can get hard to remember which argument goes where, not to mention the
annoyance of having to pass <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">undefined</span></tt> as a second argument when a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">length</span></tt> argument is used. We can make passing arguments to this function
more comprehensive by wrapping them in an object.</p>

</div>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">defaultTo</span></tt> function is useful for adding default values to an object. It
copies the properties of its second argument into its first argument, skipping
those that already have a value.</p>
