<p>This chapter does not introduce any new JavaScript-specific concepts. Instead,
we will go through the solution to two problems, discussing some interesting
algorithms and techniques along the way. If this does not sound interesting to
you, it is safe to skip to the next chapter.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Let me introduce our first problem. Take a look at this map. It shows Hiva Oa,
a small tropical island in the Pacific Ocean.</p>
<img alt="Hiva Oa Map" src="_images/HivaOa.png" />
<p>The gray lines are roads, and the numbers next to them are the lengths of these
roads. Imagine we need a program that finds the shortest route between two
points on Hiva Oa. How could we approach that? Think about this for a moment.</p>
<p>No really. Don&#8217;t just steamroll on to the next paragraph. Try to seriously
think of some ways you could do this, and consider the issues you would come up
against. When reading a technical book, it is way too easy to just zoom over
the text, nod solemnly, and promptly forget what you have read. If you make a
sincere effort to solve a problem, it becomes <em>your</em> problem, and its solution
will be more meaningful.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The first aspect of this problem is, again, representing our data.  The
information in the picture does not mean much to our computer.  We could try
writing a program that looks at the map and extracts the information in it...
but that can get complicated. If we had twenty-thousand maps to interpret, this
would be a good idea, in this case we will do the interpretation ourself and
transcribe the map into a more computer-friendly format.</p>
<p>What does our program need to know? It has to be able to look up which
locations are connected, and how long the roads between them are. The places
and roads on the island form a graph, as mathematicians call it. There are many
ways to store graphs. A simple possibility is to just store an array of road
objects, each of which contains properties naming its two endpoints and its
length...</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">roads</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="nx">point1</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Point Kiukiu&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">point2</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hanaiapa&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">length</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">},</span>
             <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">point1</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Point Kiukiu&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">point2</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Mt Feani&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">length</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">}</span>
             <span class="cm">/* and so on */</span><span class="p">];</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>However, it turns out that the program, as it is working out a route, will very
often need to get a list of all the roads that start at a certain location,
like a person standing on a crossroads will look at a signpost and read
&#8220;Hanaiapa: 19km, Mount Feani: 15km&#8221;. It would be nice if this was easy (and
quick) to do.</p>
<p>With the representation given above, we have to sift through the whole list of
roads, picking out the relevant ones, every time we want this signpost list. A
better approach would be to store this list directly. For example, use an
object that associates place-names with signpost lists:</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">roads</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s2">&quot;Point Kiukiu&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[{</span><span class="nx">to</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hanaiapa&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">distance</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">},</span>
                              <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">to</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Mt Feani&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">distance</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">},</span>
                              <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">to</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Taaoa&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">distance</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">}],</span>
             <span class="s2">&quot;Taaoa&quot;</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="cm">/* et cetera */</span><span class="p">]};</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When we have this object, getting the roads that leave from Point Kiukiu is
just a matter of looking at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">roads[&quot;Point</span> <span class="pre">Kiukiu&quot;]</span></tt>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>However, this new representation does contain duplicate information: The road
between A and B is listed both under A and under B. The first representation
was already a lot of work to type in, this one is even worse.</p>
<p>Fortunately, we have at our command the computer&#8217;s talent for repetitive work.
We can specify the roads once, and have the correct data structure be generated
by the computer. First, initialise an empty object called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">roads</span></tt>, and write
a function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">makeRoad</span></tt>:</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">roads</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{};</span>
<span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">makeRoad</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">from</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">to</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">addRoad</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">from</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">to</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="o">!</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">from</span> <span class="k">in</span> <span class="nx">roads</span><span class="p">))</span>
            <span class="nx">roads</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">from</span><span class="p">]</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[];</span>
        <span class="nx">roads</span><span class="p">[</span><span class="nx">from</span><span class="p">].</span><span class="nx">push</span><span class="p">({</span><span class="nx">to</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">to</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">distance</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="nx">length</span><span class="p">});</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="nx">addRoad</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">from</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">to</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="nx">addRoad</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">to</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">from</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Nice, huh? Notice how the inner function, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">addRoad</span></tt>, uses the same names
(<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">from</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">to</span></tt>) for its parameters as the outer function. These will not
interfere: inside <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">addRoad</span></tt> they refer to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">addRoad</span></tt>&#8216;s parameters, and
outside it they refer to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">makeRoad</span></tt>&#8216;s parameters.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">if</span></tt> statement in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">addRoad</span></tt> makes sure that there is an array of
destinations associated with the location named by <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">from</span></tt>, if there isn&#8217;t
already one it puts in an empty array.  This way, the next line can assume
there is such an array and safely push the new road onto it.</p>
<p>Now the map information looks like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">makeRoad</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Point Kiukiu&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Hanaiapa&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">makeRoad</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Point Kiukiu&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Mt Feani&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="nx">makeRoad</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Point Kiukiu&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Taaoa&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">15</span><span class="p">);</span>
<span class="c1">// ...</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>We managed to considerably shorten our description of the road-information by
defining some convenient operations. You could say we expressed the information
more succinctly by expanding our vocabulary. Defining a &#8216;little language&#8217; like
this is often a very powerful technique â when, at any time, you find yourself
writing repetitive or redundant code, stop and try to come up with a vocabulary
that makes it shorter and denser.</p>
<p>Redundant code is not only a bore to write, it is also error-prone, people pay
less attention when doing something that doesn&#8217;t require them to think. On top
of that, repetitive code is hard to change, because structure that is repeated
a hundred times has to be changed a hundred times when it turns out to be
incorrect or suboptimal.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>If you ran all the pieces of code above, you should now have a variable named
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">roads</span></tt> that contains all the roads on the island.  When we need the roads
starting from a certain place, we could just do <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">roads[place]</span></tt>. But then,
when someone makes a typo in a place name, which is not unlikely with these
names, he will get <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">undefined</span></tt> instead of the array he expects, and strange
errors will follow. Instead, we will use a function that retrieves the road
arrays, and yells at us when we give it an unknown place name:</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">roadsFrom</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">place</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">found</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="kc">undefined</span><span class="p">)</span>
        <span class="k">throw</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nb">Error</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;No place named &#39;&quot;</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="nx">place</span> <span class="o">+</span> <span class="s2">&quot;&#39; found.&quot;</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="k">else</span>

</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Here is a first stab at a path-finding algorithm, the gambler&#8217;s method:</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">gamblerPath</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">from</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">to</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">randomDirection</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">from</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">options</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">roadsFrom</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">from</span><span class="p">);</span>

    <span class="p">}</span>

    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">path</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">[];</span>
    <span class="k">while</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="nx">path</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">push</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">from</span><span class="p">);</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">from</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="nx">to</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="k">break</span><span class="p">;</span>
        <span class="nx">from</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">randomDirection</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">from</span><span class="p">);</span>
    <span class="p">}</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">path</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">gamblerPath</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&quot;Hanaiapa&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Mt Feani&quot;</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>At every split in the road, the gambler rolls his dice to decide which road he
shall take. If the dice sends him back the way he came, so be it. Sooner or
later, he will arrive at his destination, since all places on the island are
connected by roads.</p>
<p>The most confusing line is probably the one containing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Math.random</span></tt>. This
function returns a pseudo-random number between 0 and 1. Try calling it a few
times from the console, it will (most likely) give you a different number every
time. The function <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">randomInteger</span></tt> multiplies this number by the argument it
is given, and rounds the result down with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Math.floor</span></tt>. Thus, for example,
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">randomInteger(3)</span></tt> will produce the number <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">0</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">1</span></tt>, or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">2</span></tt>.</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="first admonition-title">Note</p>
<p class="last">Computers are deterministic machines: They always react in the same way to
the input they receive, so they can not produce truly random values.
Therefore, we have to make do with series of numbers that look random, but
are in fact the result of some complicated deterministic computation.</p>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The gambler&#8217;s method is the way to go for those who abhor structure and
planning, who desperately search for adventure. We set out to write a program
that could find the <em>shortest</em> route between places though, so something else
will be needed.</p>
<p>A very straightforward approach to solving such a problem is called &#8220;generate
and test&#8221;. It goes like this:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Generate all possible routes.</li>
<li>In this set, find the shortest one that actually connects the start point to
the end point.</li>
</ol>
<p>Step two is not hard. Step one is a little problematic. If you allow routes
with circles in them, there is an infinite amount of routes. Of course, routes
with circles in them are unlikely to be the shortest route to anywhere, and
routes that do not start at the start point do not have to be considered
either. For a small graph like Hiva Oa, it should be possible to generate all
non-cyclic (circle-free) routes starting from a certain point.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>But first, we will need some new tools. The first is a function named
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">member</span></tt>, which is used to determine whether an element is found within an
array. The route will be kept as an array of names, and when arriving at a new
place, the algorithm calls <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">member</span></tt> to check whether we have been at that
place already. It could look like this:</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">function</span> <span class="nx">member</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">array</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">found</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">false</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="nx">forEach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">array</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">element</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
        <span class="k">if</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">element</span> <span class="o">===</span> <span class="nx">value</span><span class="p">)</span>
            <span class="nx">found</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kc">true</span><span class="p">;</span>
    <span class="p">});</span>
    <span class="k">return</span> <span class="nx">found</span><span class="p">;</span>
<span class="p">}</span>

<span class="nx">alert</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">member</span><span class="p">([</span><span class="mi">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Bordeaux&quot;</span><span class="p">],</span> <span class="mi">7</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>However, this will go over the whole array, even if the value is found
immediately at the first position. What wastefulness. When using a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt>
loop, you can use the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">break</span></tt> statement to jump out of it, but in a
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">forEach</span></tt> construct this will not work, because the body of the loop is a
function, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">break</span></tt> statements do not jump out of functions. One solution
could be to adjust <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">forEach</span></tt> to recognise a certain kind of exceptions as
signalling a break.</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">Break</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="nx">toString</span><span class="o">:</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="k">return</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Break&quot;</span><span class="p">;}};</span>

<p>Now, if the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">action</span></tt> function throws <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Break</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">forEach</span></tt> will absorb the
exception and stop looping. The object stored in the variable <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Break</span></tt> is used
purely as a thing to compare with. The only reason I gave it a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">toString</span></tt>
property is that this might be useful to figure out what kind of strange value
you are dealing with if you somehow end up with a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Break</span></tt> exception outside
of a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">forEach</span></tt>.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Having a way to break out of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">forEach</span></tt> loops can be very useful, but in the
case of the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">member</span></tt> function the result is still rather ugly, because you
need to specifically store the result and later return it. We could add yet
another kind of exception, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Return</span></tt>, which can be given a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">value</span></tt> property,
and have <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">forEach</span></tt> return this value when such an exception is thrown, but
this would be terribly ad-hoc and messy. What we really need is a whole new
higher-order function, called <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">any</span></tt> (or sometimes <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">some</span></tt>). It looks like
this:</p>

<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">any</span></tt> goes over the elements in an array, from left to right, and applies the

<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">any(test,</span> <span class="pre">array)</span></tt> is more or less equivalent to doing <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test(array[0])</span> <span class="pre">||</span>

<p>The same could have been done using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">concat</span></tt> method and some kind of

concatenating strings together is slower than putting them into an array and
then calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">join</span></tt>, repeatedly concatenating arrays produces a lot of
unnecessary intermediary array values.</p>

<p>Imagine what an algorithm to generate routes would look like â it starts at the
starting location, and starts to generate a route for every road leaving there.
At the end of each of these roads it continues to generate more routes. It
doesn&#8217;t run along one road, it branches out. Because of this, recursion is a
natural way to model it.</p>

<p>The function returns an array of route objects, each of which contains an array
of places that the route passes, and a length.  <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">findRoutes</span></tt> recursively
continues a route, returning an array with every possible extension of that
route. When the end of a route is the place where we want to go, it just
returns that route, since continuing past that place would be pointless. If it
is another place, we must go on. The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flatten</span></tt>/<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">map</span></tt>/<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">filter</span></tt> line is
probably the hardest to read. This is what it says: &#8220;Take all the roads going
from the current location, discard the ones that go to places that this route
has already visited. Continue each of these roads, which will give an array of
finished routes for each of them, then put all these routes into a single big
array that we return.&#8221;</p>
<p>That line does a lot. This is why good abstractions help: They allow you to say
complicated things without typing screenfulls of code.</p>
<p>Doesn&#8217;t this recurse forever, seeing how it keeps calling itself (via
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">continueRoute</span></tt>)? No, at some point, all outgoing roads will go to places
that a route has already passed, and the result of <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">filter</span></tt> will be an empty
array. Mapping over an empty array produces an empty array, and flattening that
still gives an empty array. So calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">findRoutes</span></tt> on a dead end produces an
empty array, meaning &#8216;there are no ways to continue this route&#8217;.</p>
<p>Notice that places are appended to routes by using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">concat</span></tt>, not <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">push</span></tt>.
The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">concat</span></tt> method creates a new array, while <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">push</span></tt> modifies the existing
array. Because the function might branch off several routes from a single
partial route, we must not modify the array that represents the original route,
because it must be used several times.</p>

<p>Let us see what route our algorithm comes up with between Point Kiukiu and

<p>On a small island like Hiva Oa, it is not too much work to generate all
possible routes. If you try to do that on a reasonably detailed map of, say,
Belgium, it is going to take an absurdly long time, not to mention an absurd
amount of memory. Still, you have probably seen those online route-planners.
These give you a more or less optimal route through a gigantic maze of roads in
just a few seconds. How do they do it?</p>
<p>If you are paying attention, you may have noticed that it is not necessary to
generate all routes all the way to the end. If we start comparing routes
<em>while</em> we are building them, we can avoid building this big set of routes,
and, as soon as we have found a single route to our destination, we can stop
extending routes that are already longer than that route.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>To try this out, we will use a 20 by 20 grid as our map:</p>
<img alt="20 by 20 grid" src="_images/height.png" />
<p>What you see here is an elevation map of a mountain landscape. The yellow spots
are the peaks, and the blue spots the valleys. The area is divided into squares
with a size of a hundred meters. We have at our disposal a function
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">heightAt</span></tt>, which can give us the height, in meters, of any square on that
map, where squares are represented by objects with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">x</span></tt> and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">y</span></tt> properties.</p>

<p>We want to cross this landscape, on foot, from the top left to the bottom
right. A grid can be approached like a graph. Every square is a node, which is
connected to the squares around it.</p>
<p>We do not like wasting energy, so we would prefer to take the easiest route
possible. Going uphill is heavier than going downhill, and going downhill is
heavier than going (No really, it is). This function calculates the amount of
&#8220;weighted meters&#8221;, between two adjacent squares, which represents how tired you
get from walking (or climbing) between them. Going uphill is counted as twice
as heavy as going downhill.</p>

<p>Note the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">flatDistance</span></tt> calculation. If the two points are on the same row or
column, they are right next to each other, and the distance between them is a
hundred meters. Otherwise, they are assumed to be diagonally adjacent, and the
diagonal distance between two squares of this size is a hundred times the
square root of two, which is approximately <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">141</span></tt>. One is not allowed to call
this function for squares that are further than one step apart. (It could
double-check this... but it is too lazy.)</p>

<p>To find a route on this map without having our browser cut off the program
because it takes too long to finish, we have to stop our amateurish attempts
and implement a serious algorithm. A lot of work has gone into problems like
this in the past, and many solutions have been designed (some brilliant, others
useless). A very popular and efficient one is called A* (pronounced A-star).
We will spend the rest of the chapter implementing an A* route-finding
function for our map.</p>
<p>Before I get to the algorithm itself, let me tell you a bit more about the
problem it solves. The trouble with searching routes through graphs is that, in
big graphs, there are an awful lot of them. Our Hiva Oa path-finder showed
that, when the graph is small, all we needed to do was to make sure our paths
didn&#8217;t revisit points they had already passed. On our new map, this is not
enough anymore.</p>
<p>The fundamental problem is that there is too much room for going in the wrong
direction. Unless we somehow manage to steer our exploration of paths towards
the goal, a choice we make for continuing a given path is more likely to go in
the wrong direction than in the right direction. If you keep generating paths
like that, you end up with an enormous amount of paths, and even if one of them
accidentally reaches the end point, you do not know whether that is the
shortest path.</p>
<p>So what you want to do is explore directions that are likely to get you to the
end point first. On a grid like our map, you can get a rough estimate of how
good a path is by checking how long it is and how close its end is to the end
point. By adding path length and an estimate of the distance it still has to
go, you can get a rough idea of which paths are promising. If you extend
promising paths first, you are less likely to waste time on useless ones.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>But that still is not enough. If our map was of a perfectly flat plane, the
path that looked promising would almost always be the best one, and we could
use the above method to walk right to our goal. But we have valleys and
hillsides blocking our paths, so it is hard to tell in advance which direction
will be the most efficient path. Because of this, we still end up having to
explore way too many paths.</p>
<p>To correct this, we can make clever use of the fact that we are constantly
exploring the most promising path first. Once we have determined that path A is
the best way to get to point X, we can remember that. When, later on, path B
also gets to point X, we know that it is not the best route, so we do not have
to explore it further. This can prevent our program from building a lot of
pointless paths.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The algorithm, then, goes something like this...</p>
<p>There are two pieces of data to keep track of. The first one is called the open
list, it contains the partial routes that must still be explored. Each route
has a score, which is calculated by adding its length to its estimated distance
from the goal. This estimate must always be optimistic, it should never
overestimate the distance. The second is a set of nodes that we have seen,
together with the shortest partial route that got us there. This one we will
call the reached list. We start by adding a route that contains only the
starting node to the open list, and recording it in the reached list.</p>
<p>Then, as long as there are any nodes in the open list, we take out the one that
has the lowest (best) score, and find the ways in which it can be continued (by
calling <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">possibleDirections</span></tt>). For each of the nodes this returns, we create
a new route by appending it to our original route, and adjusting the length of
the route using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">weightedDistance</span></tt>. The endpoint of each of these new routes
is then looked up in the reached list.</p>
<p>If the node is not in the reached list yet, it means we have not seen it
before, and we add the new route to the open list and record it in the reached
list. If we <em>had</em> seen it before, we compare the score of the new route to the
score of the route in the reached list. If the new route is shorter, we replace
the existing route with the new one. Otherwise, we discard the new route, since
we have already seen a better way to get to that point.</p>
<p>We continue doing this until the route we fetch from the open list ends at the
goal node, in which case we have found our route, or until the open list is
empty, in which case we have found out that there is no route. In our case the
map contains no unsurmountable obstacles, so there is always a route.</p>
<p>How do we know that the first full route that we get from the open list is also
the shortest one? This is a result of the fact that we only look at a route
when it has the lowest score. The score of a route is its actual length plus an
<em>optimistic</em> estimate of the remaining length. This means that if a route has
the lowest score in the open list, it is always the best route to its current
endpoint â it is impossible for another route to later find a better way to
that point, because if it were better, its score would have been lower.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Try not to get frustrated when the fine points of why this works are still
eluding you. When thinking about algorithms like this, having seen &#8216;something
like it&#8217; before helps a lot, it gives you a point of reference to compare the
approach to. Beginning programmers have to do without such a point of
reference, which makes it rather easy to get lost. Just realise that this is
advanced stuff, globally read over the rest of the chapter, and come back to it
later when you feel like a challenge.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>I am afraid that, for one aspect of the algorithm, I&#8217;m going to have to invoke
magic again. The open list needs to be able to hold a large amount of routes,
and to quickly find the route with the lowest score among them. Storing them in
a normal array, and searching through this array every time, is way too slow,
so I give you a data structure called a binary heap. You create them with
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">new</span></tt>, just like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Date</span></tt> objects, giving them a function that is used to
&#8216;score&#8217; its elements as argument. The resulting object has the methods <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">push</span></tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop</span></tt>, just like an array, but <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">pop</span></tt> always gives you the element with
the lowest score, instead of the one that was <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">push</span></tt>ed last.</p>

<p><a class="reference internal" href="app_b.html#binary-heaps-appendix"><em>Appendix B: Binary Heaps</em></a> discusses the implementation of this data
structure, which is quite interesting. After you have read <a class="reference internal" href="ch11.html#oop-chapter"><em>Object-oriented Programming</em></a>,
you might want to take a look at it.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>The need to squeeze out as much efficiency as we can has another effect. The
Hiva Oa algorithm used arrays of locations to store routes, and copied them
with the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">concat</span></tt> method when it extended them. This time, we can not afford
to copy arrays, since we will be exploring lots and lots of routes. Instead, we
use a &#8220;chain&#8221; of objects to store a route. Every object in the chain has some
properties, such as a point on the map, and the length of the route so far, and
it also has a property that points at the previous object in the chain.
Something like this:</p>
<img alt="Object Chain" src="_images/objectchain.png" />
<p>Where the cyan circles are the relevant objects, and the lines represent
properties â the end with the dot points at the value of the property. Object
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt> is the start of a route here. Object <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt> is used to build a new route,
which continues from <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">A</span></tt>. It has a property, which we will call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">from</span></tt>,
pointing at the route it is based on. When we need to reconstruct a route
later, we can follow these properties to find all the points that the route
passed. Note that object <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">B</span></tt> is part of two routes, one that ends in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">D</span></tt>
and one that ends in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">E</span></tt>. When there are a lot of routes, this can save us
much storage space â every new route only needs one new object for itself, the
rest is shared with other routes that started the same way.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Defining a type of data structure by providing a set of functions to create and
manipulate such structures is a useful technique. It makes it possible to
&#8216;isolate&#8217; the code that makes use of the structure from the details of the
structure itself. Note that, no matter which of the above two implementations
is used, code that needs a reached list works in exactly the same way. It
doesn&#8217;t care what kind of objects are used, as long as it gets the results it
expected.</p>
<p>This will be discussed in much more detail in <a class="reference internal" href="ch11.html#oop-chapter"><em>Object-oriented Programming</em></a>, where we will
learn to make object types like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">BinaryHeap</span></tt>, which are created using <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">new</span></tt>
and have methods to manipulate them.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />

</div>
<p>First, it creates the data structures it needs, one open list and one reached
list. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">routeScore</span></tt> is the scoring function given to the binary heap. Note how
it stores its result in the route object, to prevent having to re-calculate it
multiple times.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">addOpenRoute</span></tt> is a convenience function that adds a new route to both the
open list and the reached list. It is immediately used to add the start of the
route. Note that route objects always have the properties <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">point</span></tt>, which
holds the point at the end of the route, and <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">length</span></tt>, which holds the
current length of the route.  Routes which are more than one square long also
have a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">from</span></tt> property, which points at their predecessors.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">while</span></tt> loop, as was described in the algorithm, keeps taking the
lowest-scoring route from the open list and checks whether this gets us to the
goal point. If it does not, we must continue by expanding it. This is what the
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">forEach</span></tt> takes care of. It looks up this new point in the reached list. If
it is not found there, or the node found has a longer length that the new
route, a new route object is created and added to the open list and reached
list, and the existing route (if any) is removed from the open list.</p>
<p>What if the route in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">known</span></tt> is not on the open list? It has to be, because
routes are only removed from the open list when they have been found to be the
most optimal route to their endpoint. If we try to remove a value from a binary
heap that is not on it, it will throw an exception, so if my reasoning is
wrong, we will probably see an exception when running the function.</p>
<p>When code gets complex enough to make you doubt certain things about it, it is
a good idea to add some checks that raise exceptions when something goes wrong.
That way, you know that there are no weird things happening &#8216;silently&#8217;, and
when you break something, you immediately see what you broke.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Note that this algorithm does not use recursion, but still manages to explore
all those branches. The open list more or less takes over the role that the
function call stack played in the recursive solution to the Hiva Oa problem â
it keeps track of the paths that still have to be explored. Every recursive
algorithm can be rewritten in a non-recursive way by using a data structure to
store the &#8220;things that must still be done&#8221;.</p>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Well, let us try our path-finder:</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">route</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">findRoute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nx">point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">));</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>If you ran all the code above, and did not introduce any errors, that call,
though it might take a few seconds to run, should give us a route object. This
object is rather hard to read. That can be helped by using the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">showRoute</span></tt>
function which, if your console is big enough, will show a route on a map.</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">showRoute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">route</span><span class="p">);</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>You can also pass multiple routes to <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">showRoute</span></tt>, which can be useful when
you are, for example, trying to plan a scenic route, which must include the
beautiful viewpoint at <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">11</span></tt>, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">17</span></tt>.</p>
<div class="highlight-javascript"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nx">showRoute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">findRoute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">0</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nx">point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">17</span><span class="p">)),</span>
          <span class="nx">findRoute</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">11</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">17</span><span class="p">),</span> <span class="nx">point</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="mi">19</span><span class="p">)));</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<hr class="docutils" />
<p>Variations on the theme of searching an optimal route through a graph can be
applied to many problems, many of which are not at all related to finding a
physical path. For example, a program that needs to solve a puzzle of fitting a
number of blocks into a limited space could do this by exploring the various
&#8220;paths&#8221; it gets by trying to put a certain block in a certain place. The paths
that ends up with insufficient room for the last blocks are dead ends, and the
path that manages to fit in all blocks is the solution.</p>
