<h1>Lesson 2: Files and the file system</h1>


<h2>Files</h2>
<p>
A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_file">file</a> on a modern
computer system is a named block of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information">information</a> accessible
to a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_program">computer program</a>
and stored on some type of
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-volatile_memory">non-volatile memory
</a>.
</p>
<p>
Files can contain both programs and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data">data</a>, and data files can store
text, images, sound, video, and many other kinds of data.  The two most common
types of data files for web designers are
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Text_file">text files</a> and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image">image files</a>.
</p>


<h2>File systems and directories</h2>
<p>
Operating systems organize files through the use of a 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_system">file system</a>.  File
systems provide tools for the management of files and
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directory_%28file_systems%29">
directories</a>.  A directory (or <i>folder</i>) is a special type of file that
can contain other files and directories within it.  Directories are used to
organize files to make them easier to find.
</p>
<p>
Since a directory can have directories inside it, and those directories can
directories inside them, and so on, we end up with a
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_structure">tree structure</a> for
the file system.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/lesson2/webappdev_tree_view.png" alt="Tree view of webappdev">
</p>
<p>
The screenshot above shows the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_%28Unix%29">tree</a> program display
of a directory named <code>webappdev</code> that has four subdirectories named
<code>css</code>, <code>html</code>, <code>unix</code>, and <code>vim</code>.
Each of these subdirectories has two more subdirectories named
<code>examples</code> and <code>notes</code>.  The <code>notes</code> directory
under <code>unix</code> contains two files, <code>lesson1.txt</code> and
<code>lesson2.txt</code>.
</p>


<h2>Paths</h2>
<p>
A modern computer system has hundreds of thousands of files and directories.
By utilizing the tree structure of the file system, it becomes possible to
organize and manage these hundreds of thousands of files.
</p>

<h3>Absolute Paths</h3>
<p>
At the top of the Unix file system is what is called the <b>root directory</b>,
which is always just <code>/</code> in Unix.  The <b>absolute path</b> to
any file in the filesystem is the sequence of directories, starting from the
root and ending with the file.
</p>
<p>
The easiest way to show how this works is by example.  The following diagram
shows part of a Unix filesystem tree.
</p>
<p>
<img src="images/lesson2/UnixDirectoryTree.png" alt="Unix directory tree">
</p>
<p>
The absolute path to the file <code>lesson1.txt</code> is:
</p>
<pre class="source" style="width: 480px;">
/home/jelkner/webappdev/unix/notes/lesson1.txt
</pre>


<h3>Relative Paths and the Current Working Directory</h3>
<p>
The absolute path to a file in the file system can be long, and it is normally
the case that the user is interested in files that are located in only one
small part of the system, located <q>near</q> the user.  By
<q>near the user</q> we mean near in the tree to the user's
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Current_working_directory">current
working directory</a>.
</p>
<p>
Again, it's much easier to show you than to tell you.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">
<img src="images/lesson2/pwd_inside_webappdev.png" alt="Inside webappdev">
</p>
<p>
The screenshot above shows the
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pwd">pwd</a> program displaying the
current working directory as <code>/home/jelkner/webappdev</code>.  Next
it shows <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ls">ls</a> being run, with
the <code>css</code>, <code>html</code>, <code>unix</code>, and
<code>vim</code> directories as output.  Lastly, <code>tree</code> is run
again, this time with no
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Command-line_argument#Arguments">
argument</a>.
</p>
<p>
The relative path from the current working directory to the file
<code>lesson1.txt</code> is:
</p>
<pre class="source" style="width: 240px;">
unix/notes/lesson1.txt
</pre>
<p>
Notice that relative paths <b>do not</b> start with a slash (<code>/</code>).
