<h1>What is IPCop?</h1>

<h3>What is a router?</h3>
<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Router">router</a> is a computer
that has hardware and software that have been put in the computer especially
for routing information from the router into another computer.  There are many
kinds of routers.  There is the kind that you can buy if you walk into Best
Buy, there is the kind that you can buy for thousands of dollars, and there is
the kind that we are going to be working with:  one that you make.</p>

<h3>What is IPCop?</h3>
<p><a href="http://ipcop.org">IPCop</a> is a software that you can install on
almost any computer to make it into a router.  It allows the computer to act as
a middleman between the people that are providing the internet (the ISP) and the computer that you want to hook up to the internet.</p>

<h3>Why use IPCop instead of other routers?</h3>
<p> IPCop is free software, which is a major benefit.  It comes with many
powerful features such as a firewall, the ability to act as a mail server, and
many options for how you want your router to work.  In addition, all that you
need to install IPCop is an old computer with a CD drive and two network
interface cards (NICs).  Since many people have old computers lying around, it
ends up being nearly free.  It's easy to install, and takes only a few minutes
to configure.  In addition, it comes in 32 different languages!  Haven't you
ever wanted to learn Finnish?</p>
