<h1>Configure IPCop Without Wireless</h1>

<ol>
<li>First you will be asked to enter your type of keyboard. Select US and hit 
Enter</li>
<li>Next it will ask you for your time zone, select America/New_York and hit 
Enter</li>
<li>Next it will ask you to enter the machine's hostname. By default it has 
the word ipcop as the hostname. We will leave it as ipcop so just hit OK.
<br />

<li>Next it will ask you to enter the domain name. By default the domain name 
is "localdomain". Leave the default as it is and hit OK.</li>
<li>The ISDN configuration menu will pop up. We do not use ISDN so select 
Disable ISDN.
<br />
<img src="images/isdn_configuration.jpg" alt="ISDN Configuration" /></li>
<li>Now the network configuration menu shows up and there is a lot of important 
options in this menu. First select Network configuration type.
<br />
<img src="images/network_configuration_menu.jpg" alt="Network Configuration 
Menu" /></li>
<li>We want to use a GREEN(the internal network we talked about in the last 
lesson), BLUE(internal wireless network), and RED(which is the outside 
network). Select GREEN + BLUE + RED and hit OK.
<br />
<img src="images/wireless_network_configuration_type.jpg" alt="Wireless Network 
Configuration Type" /></li>
<li>Now select Drivers and card assignments from the Network configuration 
menu.</li>
<li>Earlier, IPCop automatically detected the NIC for the GREEN interface but 
the NIC for the RED and BLUE interfaces are still undetermined. It will ask 
you if you wish to change the current settings. Hit OK.</li>
<li>IPCop will find an available driver and give you the option to assign it 
to the RED or BLUE interface. Select the correct interface that goes with that 
driver and hit OK.
<br />

<br />
Then it will find the other available driver and give you 
the option to assign it to the remaining interface. Hit OK.
<br />
<img src="images/card_assignment.jpg" alt="Second Card Assignment" /></li>
<li>You will then get a success screen saying all the cards have been assigned
</li>
<li>At the Network configuration menu select Address settings and then select 
the RED interface.</li>
<li>Because the RED interface is the outside network, the IP address is set by 
DHCP so select DHCP from the list of options and hit OK.
<br />
<img src="images/red_interface.jpg" alt="RED Interface" /></li>
<li>Back at the address settings screen select the BLUE interface.</li>
<li>Because the BLUE interface is the wireless internal network, we are going 
to give it a non-routable IP address. Enter 192.0.0.1 for the IP address and 
the network mask should be already entered but if it's not enter 
255.255.255.0 and hit OK.
<br />
<img src="images/wireless_blue_interface.jpg" alt="BLUE Interface" /></li>
<li>Back at the address settings screen select Done.</li>
<li>At the Network configuration menu select DNS and Gateway settings</li>
<li>For Primary DNS enter 158.59.255.10. For the Secondary DNS enter 
158.59.255.11. For Default Gateway enter 192.168.217.1 and hit OK.
<br />
<img src="images/dns_and_gateway_settings.jpg" alt="DNS and Gateway Settings" 
/></li>
<li>Back at the Network configuration screen select Done.</li>
<li>At DHCP Server Configuration page don't change anything just hit OK.
<br />
<img src="images/dhcp_server_configuration.jpg" alt="DHCP Server 
Configuration" /></li>
<li>Enter the password for root (NOTE it does not display the text you are 
typing; just type the first line then move down and type the second line and 
hit OK)
<br />
<img src="images/root_password.jpg" alt="Root Password" /></li>
<li>Enter the password for admin</li>
<li>Enter the password for backup</li>
<li>Setup is Complete</li>
<li>Now you have to use an Ethernet cable to connect your wireless access 
point to the network card you assigned to the BLUE interface. Also plug the 
wireless access point into a power source and turn it on. You are now ready to 
use your wireless network.</li>
