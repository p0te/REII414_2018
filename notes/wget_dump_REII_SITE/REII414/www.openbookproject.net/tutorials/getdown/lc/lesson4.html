<h1>Lesson 4: Half Adders</h1>

<h3>Halfway to Full Adders</h3>

<p>Half Adders are the next step to understanding full adders (actually, they
are the last step, because once you understand half adders, the rest is easy).
A half adder is simply an exclusive OR gate (as seen in the previous lesson) and
an AND gate.  Notice how the wires are connected together; if the wires were
not connected properly, then the logic circuit would not work.</p>

<p>As you can see in Figure 4 above, a half adder also has its own unique
symbol, represented by the drawing at the bottom right of the picture.  The half
adder has 2 inputs and 2 outputs.</p>

<p>Now it is time to learn binary mathematics.  In the chart below are the rules
of binary addition:</p>

<pre style='text-align: center'>
A + B = S  and Cout is -
0 + 0 = 0  and Cout is 0
0 + 1 = 1  and Cout is 0
1 + 0 = 1  and Cout is 0
1 + 1 = 0  and Cout is 1
</pre>

<p>You also need to know that "1" equals an electrical charge.  Now when you
are building one with real transistors, you can understand what the circuit is
doing.</p>

<h2>Exercises:</h2>
<ol>
<li>
Try all the input combinations in your head or on a piece of paper, and track
the way the inputs are changed.  Also, pay attention to the outputs.  This
exercise will help you later as the logic circuits become more complicated.
