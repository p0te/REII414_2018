<h1>Lesson 5:  Full Adders</h1>

<h3>The Final Step...  Just kidding.</h3>

<p>Full adders are obviously made of 2 half adders, as well as an OR gate.
What is special about a Full adder is that is has 3 inputs and only 2 outputs.
In a later lesson you will see how this makes sense.  Cin stands for "carry in"
and Cout stands for "carry out."  Each Cin is connected to the Cout of a
previous full adder.  Each bit of the input, in a pair of A and B, is used for every following full adder.</p>

<p>The image below is the written representation of a full adder and its
3 inputs (Cin, A, B) and 2 outputs (Cout, S).  The chart below shows the
combinations of inputs and their resulting outputs:</p>
