<h1>Lesson 2 - Mistakes</h1>

<p>So you're bound to make a bunch of mistakes while editing and using bzr; either you'll commit and then regret the commit, or you'll commit too soon. Here is how to deal with those problems.</p>
<p>Let's make a bad edit to test1.txt. Change the line to "Testing 1, 2, 4". Commit this.</p>
<blockquote><p><b>Note:</b> <tt>bzr ci</tt> is short for <tt>bzr commit</tt>.</p></blockquote>
<pre class="source"><tt>bzr ci</tt> -m "Changed wording in test1.txt"</pre>
<p>In case you commit a revision that you don't want, as we did there, you can revert the change. When reverting, you can revert either the entire change, or just the change to one file; meaning, we could do:</p>
<pre class="source"><tt>bzr revert</tt> --revision 1</pre>
<p>Which would revert the entire second revision (you put in 1 because that the version that you want to get back); or you can do:</p>
<pre class="source"><tt>bzr revert</tt> test1.txt --revision 1</pre>
<p>Which would revert only the edits made to test1.txt from the first revision.</p>
<p>The output should be:</p>
<pre class="source"> M  test1.txt</pre>
<p>Sometimes you need to know the revision number in order to perform bzr commands; for example, we just went over bzr revert, and there you obviously need to know what version you want to revert back to. <tt>bzr log</tt> is somewhat arbitrary because it shows all of the revisions and their reasons for committing (the message you type with "-m" when committing), and it also can only show so many revisions in one screen; once you have too many revisions it takes time to scroll up to the top, especially excessive given that all you need is a number. <tt>revno</tt> does just that - it returns the current revision you are on, thus allowing you quick access to perform commands that require the revision number.</p>
<pre class="source"><tt>bzr revno</tt></pre>
<p>And the output is simply an integer.</p>
<p>Alternatively, say you make a commit, but then you notice that you forgot to do something. For example, in each file except test3.txt, add (without quotes) "By: [Your_Name]". Commit this however you want.</p>
<p>Now, you realize that you should have added the same line to test3.txt, but instead of editing it and creating another commit, you can just uncommit the last revision.</p>
<pre class="source"><tt>bzr uncommit</tt></pre>
<p>Then edit test3.txt and commit again.</p>
