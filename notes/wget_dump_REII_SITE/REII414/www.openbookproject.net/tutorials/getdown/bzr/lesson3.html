<h1>Lesson 3 - Remove Files</h1>

<p>Since you have already learned how to add files with <tt>bzr add</tt> its time to learn about removing files. Say you want to remove test3.txt from the repository</p>
<pre class="source"><tt>bzr remove --force </tt>test3.txt</pre>
<p>This will now delete the file from the repository. If you tried removing the file without bzr (the same way you would remove any other file on your computer) then you would have removed the file, but it would not be deleted from the repository.</p>
<pre class="source"><tt>deleted test3.txt</tt></pre>
<p>This is what will come up after forcing the delete. If you deleted the wrong file you can revert to get the file back.</p>
