<h1>Lesson 1 - Basic bzr</h1>

<p>First let's establish who you are. (Replace the name and email with your
name and email.)</p>
<pre class="source"><code>bzr whoami</code>
"John Doe &lt;john.doe@gmail.com&gt;"
</pre>
<p>
Now if you type <code>bzr whoami</tt> - you should get what you typed in.</p>
<p>We're going to need a directory:
</p>
<pre class="source">
<tt>mkdir</tt> test_dir
</pre>
<p>Now <tt>cd</tt> into that folder. Then, to say that you want to use bzr in
it:</p>
<pre class="source"><tt>bzr init</tt></pre>
<p>Let's create a few subdirectories &amp; files:</p>
<pre class="source"><tt>mkdir</tt> sub_dir
<tt>touch</tt> test1.txt test2.txt test3.txt sub_dir/test4.txt
</pre>
<p>Next, you want bzr to keep track of all those files and the directory. The
command <tt>bzr add *</tt> will recursively add every file and directory within
your current directory</p> <pre class="source"><tt>bzr add *</tt></pre>
<blockquote><p><b>Note:</b> You'll have to use bzr add whenever you add a new
file/directory.</p></blockquote> <p>Next, take a snapshot of your files by
committing them to your branch. Add a message to explain why you made the
commit:</p> <pre class="source"><tt>bzr commit -m</tt> "Initial import"</pre>

<p>So, you have four files, one in a subdirectory, called sub_dir. Open
test1.txt; copy and paste (without quotes) this line into the file: "Testing 1,
2, 3"; save it and go back to the terminal screen.</p> <p>Now when you type
<tt>bzr diff</tt> you should get something like this:</p>

<pre class="source">=== modified file 'test1.txt'
--- test1.txt   2008-06-04 15:57:45 +0000
+++ test1.txt   2008-06-04 16:01:37 +0000
@@ -0,0 +1,1 @@
+Testing 1, 2, 3
</pre>

<p>The only really important thing there is the bottom line; it says that there
is one difference from the last commit and the current version of the file, you
added a line, "Testing 1, 2, 3".</p>

<p>Now let's commit that revision, essentially we'll be taking a new snapshot
of the files.</p>
<pre class="source"><tt>bzr commit</tt> -m "Added first line to test1.txt"</pre>
<p>There's actually a way to view the log; which shows each revision.</p>
<pre class="source"><tt>bzr log</tt></pre>
<p>You should get a result like this:</p>
<pre class="source">------------------------------------------------------------
