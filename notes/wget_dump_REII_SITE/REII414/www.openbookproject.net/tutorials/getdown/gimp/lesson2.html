<h1>Lesson 2: <q>Change</q> Tools</h1>

<p>Now let's explore the next set of tools. These are what we like referring to
as <q>the change tools.</q></p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/change_tools.jpg"
alt="Change Tools"/>Change Tools</div>

<p>The first of these tools is the alignment tool.</p> 

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/alignment_tool.jpg"
alt="The Alignment Tool" />The Alignment Tool</div>

<p>It's base purpose is to align text around a given image. When the tool is
selected the following menu is brought up.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/alignment_menu.jpg"
alt="Alignment Menu" />The Alignment Menu</div>

<p>There are two different ways to align. The first method is called
<code>Relative To:</code>. This aligns the object that needs to be aligned
around a selected object.  There are two sets of control keys. The first set of
keys corrosponds with <code>Relative To</code>.</p>

<p>Look at where it says <code>First Item</code>. This is a drop down menu.
This allows the user to align the item that needs aligning to be aligned with
the selections. The options are the following:</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/alignment_drop_down.jpg"
alt="Align Relative To Menu" />Relative To Dropdown Menu</div>

<p>The next set is called <code>Distribute</code>. The controls are relatively
the same, except the function is different. The <code>Relative to</code> will
align around a certain object, but the distribute will align around the entire
image.</p>

<p>The next tool is called the crop tool</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/crop.jpg"
alt="Crop Tool" />Crop Tool</div>

<p>The purpose of this tool is to take an image and cut out a piece of that
image and make a new image from it. *Note this is different then scaling the
image because it will cut out the unselected parts. Observe.</p>

<h4>Before</h4>
<div><img class="center" alt="Sky" src="images/sky.jpg" /><br/></div>

<h4>After</h4>
<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/sky_crop.jpg"
alt="Sky Crop" /></div>

<p>See the change in the size of the image.</p>

<p>The next tool is called the rotate tool.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/rotate.jpg"
alt="Rotate" />Rotate Tool</div>

<p>The purpose of this tool is to rotate the image via its axis. This is the
menu for it.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/rotate_menu.jpg"
alt="Rotate Menu" />Rotate Menu</div>

<p>First click on the rotate tool in the GIMP menu. Then go to the layer that
is meant to be edited and click on it. Then click the actual picture. Start by
clicking any of the corners and move the mouse so that the image is rotated as
much as you want. The proccess should vaguely look like this.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/rotate_show.jpg"
alt="Show Rotate" />Show Rotate</div>

<p>The other way of rotating is by using the rotate menu.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/rotate_settings.jpg"
alt="Rotate Settings" />Rotate Settings</div>

<p>This has some advantages as well as disadvantages. The advantages are,
first, the image can be rotated numerically. The negative numbers rotate
counterclockwise and the positive numbers rotate clockwise. The scroll bar can
also be used for rotation. The other advantage is that the point of origin (the
place where image pivots) can be changed using the pixel numbers. However, if
the user doesn't know much about angles and what pixels are, that feature is
relatively unuseful.</p>

<p>The next tool is called the scale tool. Its purpose is to change the size of
the actual image. It differs from the crop tool because it does not select a
region, instead it expands or shrinks the entire image.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/scale.jpg"
alt="Scale Tool" />Scale Tool</div>

<p>To start the scaling process, first start by opening the image. Then click
on the image window in th GIMP. This should promt the scaling window. Make sure
the right layer is selected.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/scale_menu.jpg"
alt="Scale Menu" />Scale Menu</div>

<p>This menu allows for the user to scale and keep the proportions the same.
The other method of scaling is to click on one of the corners of the image and
drag the mouse to the appropriate size.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/scale_free_hand.jpg"
alt="Scale Free Hand" />Scale Free Hand</div>

<p>When expanding it might be useful to zoom out. To do so hit z on the
keyboard or click on the tool in the tool menu that looks like a mangifying
glass. That should prompt the zoom menu.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/zoom_menu.jpg"
alt="Zoom Menu" />Zoom Menu</div>

<p>Click zoom out and click on the image once this should zoom out once. This
allows the user to see the entire window. This is convenient because now the
real size of the layer can be seen.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/scale_expand.jpg"
alt="Expansion Process" />Expansion Process</div>

<p>The last tool in lesson 2 is called the flip tool. Its purpose is to flip an
image across its x or y axis.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/flip.jpg"
alt="Flip" />Flip</div>

<p>The menu looks like this. The aplication is pretty self-explantatory. The
tool will flip the layer in the direction selected in the menu.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/flip_menu.jpg"
alt="Flip Menu" />Flip Tool Menu</div>
