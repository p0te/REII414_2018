<h1>Lesson 1: Toolbar</h1>

<p>In this first lesson we are going to become familiar with the toolbar.</p>

<p>Here is the toolbar:</p>

<div><img class="center" src="images/tool_bar.jpg" alt="Tool Bar"></div>

<p>All of the cool effects that are available with GIMP are accessed through
the toolbar.</p>

<p>We begin with the <code>File</code> button in the top left hand corner of
the toolbar. If you left click on the <code>File</code> button, the following
will pop up:</p>

<div><img class="center" src="images/file_menu.jpg" alt="File Menu"/></div>

<p>Clicking on <code>New</code> will open up a blank image. This will allow you 
to work from scratch on your own image.</p>

<p>When you click on <code>New</code>, a window will pop up that allows you to
set the size of your blank image.</p>

<div><img class="center" src="images/new_window.jpg" alt="New Window"/></div>

<p>By default, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pixel">pixels</a> are used
as the unit of measure. To get a feel for the size of a pixel, the standard
computer desktop these days measures 1024 by 768 pixels.  If you wanted to make
a background image for your desktop you should make it that size.</p>


<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/select_tools.jpg"
alt="Select Tools"/>The Select Tools</div>

<p>The first part of the toolbar that we are going to explore is the
rectangular region tool. The button looks like this...</p>

<div><img class="center" src="images/rectangular_region.jpg"
alt="Rectangular Region"/></div>

<p>With this tool, you can create rectangular regions that you can fill with
different colors or patterns. Lets try this:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Click on the rectangular region button and move your cursor over to your
  image.</li>

  <li>Click on the image and hold the mouse button down.</li>

  <li>Move the mouse until you have a rectangle of your liking and release the
  button.</li>
</ol>

<p>This process of holding the mouse button and dragging the pointer is usually
called <q>clicking and dragging.</q>  The region you created will blink, so
don't be alarmed. It should look something like this:</p>

<div><img class="center" src="images/rectangular_region_blink.jpg"
alt="Rectangular Region Blinking"/></div>

<p>You can fill this region with a color to create a colored rectangle box.</p>

<ol>
  <li>Right click with the mouse on the blinking region.</li>

  <li>Then move down to the <code>Edit</code> button and select
  <code>Fill with FG color</code>.</li>

  <li>Your rectangle will turn black.</li>
</ol>

<p>You will now have a black box on your image. If it doesn't look like the
image below, try again.</p>

<div><img class="center" src="images/black_box.jpg" alt="Black Box"/></div>

<p>You can also change the color that you fill the boxes with by changing the
foreground or background colors that are currently set to black and white. On
the main GIMP screen there are 2 boxes (black and white; one on top of the
other). Click on the top box and select a different color.</p>

<div><img class="center" src="images/change_color.jpg"
alt="Change Color Screen" /></div>

<p>You can do similar things with the elliptical region button. The elliptical
region button looks like this:</p>

<div><img class="center" src="images/elliptical_region.jpg"
alt="Elliptical Region"/></div>

<p>With this button, you can do exactly the same things as the rectangular
region. Just click on the button, move your cursor over to your image, draw
your region, and fill the image with a color.</p>

<p>The final drawing tool that we are going to look at in this lesson is the
hand drawn region tool. The button for this tool looks like this:</p>

<div><img class="center" src="images/free_select.jpg" alt="Free Select"/></div>

<p>This is an extremely cool tool. You can create any shape you want. To use
the tool, just follow along with these steps:</p>

<ol>
  <li>First, click on the hand drawn region tool button.</li>

  <li>Then, move your cursor over to your blank image.</li>

  <li>Hold down the mouse button.</li>

  <li>Drag the cursor around to a point on the image.</li>

  <li>Then let go of the mouse button.</li>
</ol>

<p>The GIMP will automatically draw a line from your original point to the
second point where you let go of the mouse button. Here is an example...</p>

<div><img class="center" src="images/free_select_part.jpg"
alt="Free Select - Part"/></div>

<p>As you see, we started out at point A and eventually finished at point B. 
GIMP then created a straight line connecting these two points to complete the
selection.</p>

<p>We can also draw complete regions and connect the circut myself.  For
instance:</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/free_select_area.jpg"
alt="Free Select Area"/>Free Select Area</div>

<p>We used the hand drawn region tool, traced our own image and connected it
back at the original point.</p>

<div><img class="center" src="images/shapes.jpg" alt="Shapes"/></div>

<p>Alright, this is what the scissors select tool, looks like on the
toolbar.</p>

<div><img src="images/shapes_test1.jpg" alt="Shapes Test 1" />
<img src="images/shapes_test2.jpg" alt="Shapes Test 2" /></div>

<p>You will notice that this tool can make a strange selection of your
choosing. All you have to do is left click on the image and it will make a dot.
From that point, everytime you click, another dot will appear. If you click on
an existing dot, you can close the selection. Now you can alter the selection,
like filling it in with white, as I did in the picture above. You can change
the selection by dragging the borders, or by dragging a point that you've
placed.</p>
