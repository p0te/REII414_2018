<h1>Lesson 4: Layers</h1>

<p>Layers are used to seperate different pieces of an image. Layering is
supported in almost every kind of image editing software. There are different
kinds of layers and not all of them exist in all programs. Layers are stacked
on top of each other, and depending on their order, determine the appearance of
the final picture.</p>

<p>The image below has no layers yet just a paintbrush and ellipse drawing.
This will be the base or background layer.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img src="images/layers_example_base.jpg" alt="Base Layer"
class="center"/>Base Layer</div>

<p>Click on the Layer drop-down menu from the top. You will see all the options you can use for layering.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img src="images/layers_menu.jpg" alt="Layers Menu"
class="center"/>Layers Menu</div>

<p>Select New Layer from the menu. Change the Layer name to something other
than <q>New Layer</q>.  We're going to make it <q>Second</q>, but it doesn't
matter what you name it.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img src="images/layers_new.jpg" alt="New Layer"
class="center"/>New Layer</div>

<p>Use the shortcut Ctrl+L to show the Layers window. This makes it easier to 
visually see what your layers show.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img src="images/layers_window.jpg" alt="Layers Window"
class="center"/>Layers Window</div>

<p>Now on the second layer we are going to draw a pencil graphic. You can see
in the layers window that the pencil illustration showed up in the second layer
and not the first even though if you are just looking at the canvas you could
not tell that they were 2 different layers.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img src="images/layers_example_second.jpg" alt="Second Layers Example" class="center"/>Second Layer</div>

<p>We are going to add a new layer and title it <code>Third</code>. Now we have
drawn an airbrush graphic where the that covers the pencil and ellipse.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img src="images/layers_example_third.jpg" alt="Third Layers Example" class="center"/>Third Layer</div>

<p>If you go to the Layers window you will notice that the 3 layers are in a
specific order with the latest layer on top. We can move the <code>Third</code>
layer below the others and you can see what that does to the picture.</p>

<div><img src="images/layers_example_down.jpg" alt="Layer Down"
class="center"/><img src="images/layers_window_down.jpg"
alt="Layers Window - Down" class="center"/></div>

<p>There are some other more advanced technqiues with layering that you can
test out on your own.</p>
