<h1>Lesson 6: Making The Stars Image</h1>

<p>One of the most reocurring pieces of this tutorial is the stars images.
Lesson 5 is the tutorial that teaches how to create one. This lesson will have
a lot of what you haven't learned yet - but it's really just meant to show you
the type of thing you can do with the GIMP, and maybe you can pick up a few
things along the way.</p>

<p>Start by creating a new document size 1024 px by 768 px. Using the fill
tool, make the document black.</p>

<div class="source">file &gt;&gt; new &gt;&gt;</div>

<p>In the new document screen, select filters in the top bar. Then select the
<code>Noise</code> sub-menu, and then select <code>HSV Noise</code>.</p>

<div class="source">Filters
&gt;&gt; Noise &gt;&gt; HSV Noise</div>

<p>Set the <code>Holdness</code> (the first setting) to 4. Set the
<code>Hue</code> &amp; <code>Saturation</code> to 0. Set the <code>Value</code> 
as 190. Click <code>Ok</code>. You should see a few star-like dots appear.</p>

<p>Again in the new document screen (it should be title something like
<code>*Untitled-1.0</code>), select <code>Colors</code>, then select
<code>Brightness &amp; Contrast</code>.</p>

<div class="source">Colors &gt;&gt; Brightness &amp; Contrast &gt;&gt;</div>

<p>Set <code>Brightness</code> to <code>-25</code> (<b>negative</b> 25), then
set <code>Contrast</code> to <code>+55</code> (<b>positive</b> 55).</p>

<p>This should space out the dots a bit.</p>

<p>Now go into the <code>Layers</code> menu, double click on the only layer up
(probably titled <code>Background</code>), and name the layer
<code>small stars</code>. These images show what everything should look like at
this point.</p>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/stars_beginning.jpg"
alt="Stars Creation- Beginning"/>This is what your document screen should look 
like at this point.</div>

<div class="capt2"><img class="center" src="images/stars_layers_beginning.jpg"
alt="Stars Creation - Layers - Beginning"/>This is what your layers screen
should look like at this point</div>

<p>Go to your layers screen. Right click on the <code>small stars</code> layer,
and select <code>Duplicate Layer</code>. Double click this new layer, and name
it <code>big stars</code>.</p>

<p>Make sure that the <code>big stars</code> layer is selected. Again go to
<code>Colors</code>, then <code>Brightness &amp; Contrast</code>. Set
<code>Brightness</code> to <code>-70</code> (<b>negative</b> 70) and
<code>Contrast</code> to <code>+40</code> (<b>positive</b> 
<code>40</code>).</p>

<p>Now we want to enlarge the image. Press Shift-T. There should be a little
drop down on the right side of the dialogue that comes up, it should say
<code>pixels</code>, which is the default. Click the drop down, and change the
value to percent. Set both the width and height to 200 (so we're enlarging the
width and height by 200%).</p>

<div><img src="images/stars_enlarging.jpg" alt="Stars Enlarging Box"
class="center" width="250" height="114"/></div>

<p>Now we're going to try to make the stars a bit more visible. In the document
screen, select <code>Colors</code> then <code>Invert</code>, just so we can see
the stars slightly better. Then go to <code>Colors</code> then
<code>Threshold</code>. Click the <code>Auto</code> button. The stars should be 
a lot more visible now. Invert the colors again to get it back to normal.</p>

<p>Let's get this layer almost back to it's original size. We'll change the
percent value to <code>53%</code>, since obviously <code>50%</code> of
<code>200</code> is <code>100</code>. So, press Shift-T, and
change the height and width to <code>53%</code> (you might have to select
percent from the drop down menu again).</p>

<p>We'll be using the alignment tool to center the layers.</p>

<p>Click on the alignment tool. Then make sure that <code>big stars</code> is
the selected layer, and click on the images. The preferences of this tool
should now become active.</p>

<p>In the tools screen (where the alignment preferences are), click on the drop
down menu <code>Relative to:</code>, select image. Under the
<code>Relative to:</code> section (not the <code>Distribute</code> section!),
click on the two middle buttons.</p>

<p>Now they're centered.</p>

<p>Go to the Layers menu. In the <code>Mode</code> drop down menu, select
<code>Screen</code>. Now we have a zoom or echo-effect. To avoid this we simply
rotate the layer by <code>180°</code>.  (<code>Shift+R</code> to use the rotate 
tool: enter <code>180°</code>).</p>

<p>Here's where you should be so far:</p>

<div><img class="center" src="images/stars_second.jpg"
alt="Stars Second View"/></div>

<div><img class="center" src="images/stars_layers_second.jpg"
alt="Stars Layers 2" /></div>

<p>If you haven't yet - SAVE!</p>

<p>Now use the free select tool, and randomly select all around your document.
Here's what mine looked like:</p>

<div><img class="center" src="images/stars_third.jpg"
alt="Stars Third View"/></div>

<p>Now, in the document screen, go to the select drop down, then select grow.
Plug in 8 and hit <code>OK</code>. Now we're going to delete the selected parts
by simply pressing <code>Delete</code>. If anything is still selected: go to
<code>Select</code> then <code>None</code>.</p>

<p>Now create a new layer by right clicking in the layers menu, and pressing
<code>New Layer</code>. Click and drag this layer below the
<code>small stars</code> layer in the Layers menu. Make sure this layer is
selected, and fill it black.</p>

<p>Now lets activate our small stars layer. Right click the small stars layer
in the layers dialog, choose <code>Add alpha channel</code>.</p>

<p>Again use the free selection tool to select some parts of the image by
random move the selection tool all over the layer, but it should be much less
than the wild selection in step 7.</p>

<div><img src="images/stars_small.jpg" class="center" alt="Small Stars"/></div>

<p>Go to select, then feather, and put in 50px. Click <code>OK</code>. Then
delete the selection by pressing delete. The stars should be still visible, but
some may be less visible or black. If neccessary, go to <code>Select</code> then
<code>None</code>.</p>

<p>Now we're going to quickly merge everything. Just go to (in the document
screen): <code>Image</code>, then <code>Merge Visible Layers</code>, then
<code>Merge</code>.</p>

<p>In the tools menu, select the Clone tool, and, in that tool's preferences,
select <code>Screen</code> as the mode, then click on the Brush drop down menu,
and select the Sparks brush. Press Control, and click anywhere in the image
(preferably an area with a lot of stars). Then bring your mouse over to a
different point (prefereably an area with few visisble stars), and brush all
over. It might be hard to tell, but this is just randomizing the stars.</p>

<p>Duplicate the layer; name this <code>Stars glow</code> or something.</p>

<p>We're going to change a lot of settings here. First go to
<code>Filter</code> then <code>Blur</code> then <code>Gaussian Blur</code>, and 
set the horizontal to 15 (pixels), the vertical will change automatically.</p>

<p>Now go to <code>Colors</code> and then <code>Color Balance</code>. Select
shadows in the select list, and set <code>Cyan</code> to
<code>-100</code>, <code>Magneta</code> to <code>0</code> and
<code>Yellow</code> to <code>40</code>. Then select Midtone (under Shadow); set <code>Cyan</code> to <code>-100</code>, <code>Magneta</code> to <code>30</code> 
and <code>Yellow</code> to <code>40</code>. Then select <code>Highlights</code>
and set <code>Cyan</code> to <code>-100</code>, <code>Magneta</code> to
<code>30</code> and <code>Yellow</code> to <code>40</code>.</p>

<p>Now in the layers menu, in the <code>Mode</code> drop down, select
<code>Screen</code>.</p>

<p>Now, let's add some fun. Create a new layer, fill it black. Go to
<code>Filter</code>, <code>Light and Shadow</code> and then
<code>Supernova</code>. Having the filter dialog open enter any values you like
to create you shining star. But don't make it too big for the first time and
place it in the middle - this is most easily done by setting the drop down menu
to percent, and then putting 50 as the value for both. Now in the layers menu,
set the <code>Mode</code> to <code>Addition</code>. Now move the layer around
to where you want your star. You can duplicate it or scale it or whatever.</p>

<p>Optional: You can add some more color if you like. Make another layer, fill
it black, add a supernova - but this time change the color. When you do so:
notice the first two numberic values: <code>H</code> and <code>S</code>. Copy
them down - don't forget them! Set the mode to addition (after you've added the
supernova) and then go to the stars glow layer. Select an area, go to
<code>Colors</code> then <code>Colorize</code> - and plug in those values,
change the lightness to whatever you like.</p>
