Create a mathematical database that can deliver mathematical equations and/or examples.
Searches contain key words and the database uses the keywords to find equations and examples
relative to the search keywords.
The database does not necessarily need to revolve around mathematics, further ideas are:
Audio/Music compared via lyrics or key words.
Movies compared via actor name, or keywords.

My suggestion is for us to create a website that sells different products and shows their prices and allows customers to choose the product and  quantity they want. So basically an online shopping store.
