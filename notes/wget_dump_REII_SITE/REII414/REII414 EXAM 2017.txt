REII414 EXAM 2017
-----------------

Good luck with tomorrow's exam.

A convenient reminder for those who forgot - the exam is tomorrow, 20 June 2017.

It would pay off greatly if you were fluent in SQL and E-R diagrams.

However, no HTML/PHP/Javascript/CSS coding would be directly, as in pen on paper, required from you - only a solid understanding of how the Web environment works and how it integrates with database systems.

Further, all the theory covered in class up to the last one is relevant.

Please note that my last e-mail was my response on the fake one, I did not mail you since and do not intend to before the exam.
