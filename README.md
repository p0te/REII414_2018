# Welcome to the REII414_2018 git repo. 

It includes my notes from 2017 and the examples I use in facilitation

## Example 1
This example was built during facilitation and shows how to connect to the database from the webserver. It prints some data from the saleco database to html. It also has a simple html form for reference.

## Example 2
This example will be discussed next Wednesday. Andreas built it in class last year and it illustrates session management and file uploads. To run this example, it is necessary to import demo.sql to your local database server.
